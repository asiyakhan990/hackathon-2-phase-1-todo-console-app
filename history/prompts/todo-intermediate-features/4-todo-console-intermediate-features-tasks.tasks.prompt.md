## Response snapshot

Successfully generated tasks.md for the Todo Console App - Intermediate Level Features. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing:

- Total Task Count: 40 tasks (T001-T040)
- Setup Phase: 3 tasks
- Foundational Phase: 10 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1): 9 tasks - Assign Priorities and Tags
- User Story 2 (P2): 8 tasks - Search and Filter
- User Story 3 (P3): 5 tasks - Sort Tasks
- Polish Phase: 5 tasks

Each user story can be independently implemented and tested. The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, labels, and file paths. Parallel execution opportunities are identified with [P] markers.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task list for intermediate features of Todo Console App
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this task generation
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 40 structured tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are well-organized by user story and follow the template structure

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All validation items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task generation prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of the generated tasks
